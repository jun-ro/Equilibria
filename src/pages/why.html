        Suicide is a serious issue that affects many people, with depression being the most common cause associated with it.

It is important to understand the signs and take action if you suspect someone is struggling. Suicide attempts and self-harm can be prevented with proper support and care.

Depression can have many causes, including trauma, bullying, conflict, and loss. Symptoms of depression may include feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities, sleep problems, fatigue, and thoughts of death or suicide. It is important to seek professional help if you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms.

Suicide rates have been on the rise in recent years, with almost 46,000 deaths in the United States in 2020 alone. However, there are resources available to help those struggling with mental health. Connecting with family and community support, seeking professional help, and having open and honest conversations with loved ones are all important steps in preventing suicide. Remember to check up on those around you and seek immediate assistance if you believe someone is in danger of harming themselves.
